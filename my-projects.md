- My [study notes](https://github.com/IQ404/study-notes).

- // TODO: I'm planning to write a rasterizer.

- // TODO: I'm planning to use Taichi Lang to implement a few physics based simulation/animation.

- I wrote a series of [CPU-based ray tracers with a denoiser](https://github.com/IQ404/cpu-based-ray-tracer).

- I have done a [team project](https://github.com/blacktack2/MastersGroupProject2023) (where my primary focus was on designing and implementing the AI for the boss behavior) with 7 other classmates during the Computer Game Engineering MSc at Newcastle University.
    
- An incomplete [polynomial solver](https://github.com/IQ404/Coursework-CSC8501) written by me.
    
- I wrote a [binary search tree](https://github.com/IQ404/BinarySearchTree-CSC8501).

- Some [sorting algorithms](https://github.com/IQ404/TheFastestSorter-CSC8501) written by me.
  
- An unfinished rasterized scene of [a wavy sea on a rainy day](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8502) (this project is aimed to be seriously polished).
  
- An unfinished [football game](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8503) (this project is aimed to be seriously polished).

- [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/MyFirstGame) is the first game I ever made.
