# What you might find on my GitHub

- My [study notes](https://github.com/IQ404/study-notes/blob/main/README.md).
- My [PhD stuffs](https://github.com/IQ404/phd-base) (currently private).

### Ray Tracing

- I wrote a series of [CPU-based ray tracers with a denoiser](https://github.com/IQ404/cpu-based-ray-tracer).

- // TODO: I'm planning to write a volume renderer.

### Differentiable Rendering

- // TODO: I'm planning to reimplement [the 2D Gaussian Splatting project](https://github.com/OutofAi/2D-Gaussian-Splatting), just for fun.

### Rasterization

- // TODO: I'm planning to write a rasterizer.

- An unfinished rasterized scene of [a wavy sea on a rainy day](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8502) ( //TODO: this project is aimed to be seriously polished ).

### C++

- A purpose-specific [polynomial solver](https://github.com/IQ404/Coursework-CSC8501) written by me.

### Algorithms

- I wrote a [binary search tree](https://github.com/IQ404/BinarySearchTree-CSC8501).

- Some [sorting algorithms](https://github.com/IQ404/TheFastestSorter-CSC8501) written by me.

### Simulation

- // TODO: I'm planning to use Taichi Lang to implement some demo for soft-body/fluid simulation.

### Game AI

- I have done a [team project](https://github.com/blacktack2/MastersGroupProject2023) (where my primary focus was on designing and implementing the AI for the boss behavior) with 7 other classmates during the Computer Game Engineering MSc at Newcastle University.

- An unfinished [football game](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8503) ( //TODO: this project is aimed to be seriously polished ).

### Games

- [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/MyFirstGame) is the first game I ever made.

### Programming Language

- I want to write a programming language, using C, based on Ludwig Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations*. I really do! It will probably only be a toy, but a fun one. Though I'm not sure when I will have time to finish a project on such a scale....
